Notes: This comprehensive reorganization addresses all 231 bottles in plane 1, organizing them by seasonal appropriateness from rows 1-8. The 45 swaps listed represent the key bottles that need to move to create this new arrangement, with spring/summer fragrances in rows 1-3, versatile fragrances in rows 4-5, fall fragrances in row 6, and winter fragrances in rows 7-8. This arrangement optimizes accessibility for the current season while creating a logical seasonal flow throughout the entire plane.

Implementation Suggestion: Execute this reorganization in phases, starting with rows 1-3 to immediately improve access to spring-appropriate fragrances, then gradually working through the remaining rows.
