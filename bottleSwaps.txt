Notes: This swap plan is based on analysis of bottles in plane 1. It focuses on swapping less seasonally suitable bottles in the front rows with more suitable bottles in the back rows. Front rows are 1-4, back rows are 5-8. The goal is to have spring/summer appropriate bottles in the front rows for easier access during the current season.
